# 📘 Graph Algorithms in Python

This repository contains the implementation of important **graph algorithms** using **Python**.  
It includes both **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** and **individual Python script files (`.py`)** for ease of use and understanding.

## 📂 Contents

### ✅ Representations Used
- **Adjacency Matrix**
- **Adjacency List**

### ✅ Algorithms Implemented

| File Name                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `is_adjacent.py`        | Checks if two vertices are directly connected |
| `complete_graph.py`     | Determines if a graph is complete |
| `is_connected.py`       | Checks if a graph is fully connected |
| `is_tree.py`            | Determines whether the graph is a valid tree |
| `spanning_tree.py`      | Extracts a spanning tree from the graph |
| `count_leaf_nodes.py`   | Counts the number of leaf nodes in a tree |
| `is_binary_tree.py`     | Checks if the given structure is a binary tree |
| `find_height.py`        | Calculates the height of a rooted tree |
| `find_depth.py`         | Calculates the depth of a specific node |

📓 All these codes are also available together in a single notebook: `graph-algorithms.ipynb`
